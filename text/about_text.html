      <h3> About THRIVEair </h3>
          THRIVEair is a community-based air monitoring project in South and Southwest Philadelphia.
          Designed as a partnership between <a href='https://www.phillythrive.org/'> Philly Thrive </a>
          and researchers at the <a href= 'https://drexel.edu/dornsife/'> Drexel Dornsife School of Public Health</a> and
          <a href = 'https://www.lcsc.edu/'>Lewis Clark State college</a>.
          Data will be collected from summer 2023 - summer 2024.

      <h3> Interpreting These Data </h3>
           Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were monitored in one-week sessions, 
           with begin dates representing the date of monitor deployment and end dates representing the date of data retrieval.
           Concentrations shown in these results are one week averages over the sampling period.
           <br><br>
           For example, a benzene concentration of 1 µg/m³ on 6/14/23 is interpreted as 
           the <strong>one-week average concentration</strong> at that site for the week beginning on 6/7 and ending on 6/14.

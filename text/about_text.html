      <h3> About THRIVEair </h3>
          THRIVEair was a community-based air monitoring project in South and Southwest Philadelphia.
          The study was co-designed as a partnership between <a href='https://www.phillythrive.org/'> Philly Thrive </a>
          and researchers at the <a href= 'https://drexel.edu/dornsife/'> Drexel Dornsife School of Public Health</a> and
          <a href = 'https://www.lcsc.edu/'>Lewis Clark State college</a>.
          Data were collected from summer 2023 - summer 2024.

      <h3> Interpreting These Data </h3>
           Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were monitored in one-week sessions, 
           with begin dates representing the date of monitor deployment and end dates representing the date of data retrieval.
           Concentrations shown in these results are one week averages over the sampling period.
           <br><br>
           For example, a benzene concentration of 1 µg/m³ on 6/14/23 is interpreted as 
           the <strong>one-week average concentration</strong> at that site for the week beginning on 6/7 and ending on 6/14.
           <br> <br>
           We sampled at 9 sites weekly throughout the year, and at an additional 11 rotating community sites for 4 total weeks 
           each, two weeks in summer and two weeks in winter. Note that the dashboard and interactive graphs only include 
           measurements from sites we measured weekly. This is because measurements at the rotating community sites are only comparable
            to other sites that were measured during the same week--this requires a slightly more complex analysis that we are publishing 
            in a forthcoming publication. Data for rotating community sites are still downloadable in the Data Table tab.<br><br>

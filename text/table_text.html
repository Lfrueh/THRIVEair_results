      <h3> Using These Data </h3>
      <p>
         Samples were analyzed by Dr. Nancy Johnston at <a href = 'https://www.lcsc.edu/'>Lewis Clark State college</a>.<br><br>
         At this stage, data has been quality assured to level 1.<br>
         <em>Therefore, data may change and are not finalized for archiving.</em><br><br>
         While the results on the dashboard only include sites sampled weekly, the data table here includes results for all sites,
         including those sampled for only 4 total weeks throughout the study ("rotating" site type). Please note that because of this
         unbalanced sampling design, concentrations for rotating weekly sites are only comparable to other sites that were sampled 
         during the same week. <br><br>
